User Kata
=========

Kata exercise to practise TDD.

This exercise is done with javascript and using Jasmine BDD http://jasmine.github.io/ 

The objective is practise the setter and getter in javascript.

###The exercise that I propose is the following

1. Create the User class with the following properties:
  - name (string)
  - surname (string)
  - email (string)
  - telephone (integrer)
  - password (string)
  - fullname (string)

2. Create a user with a minimun data (email and password) using the previously created class . 

3. Create a method to change the properties. 

4. Allow change the value of the properties if the password provided is right.
